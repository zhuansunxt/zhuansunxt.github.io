My name is Xiaotong (Shelton) Sun. I was born and raised in China before moving to the United States, where I attended graduate school and began my career as a software engineer.

In the past, I've experimented with hosting my blog on various platforms, such as Blogger and Hexo. However, I realized that the main challenge I faced wasn't related to the tools I used but rather to maintaining a consistent writing schedule. With this new blog, I hope to create a lasting space where I can regularly update and share my thoughts.

As a software engineer, I'm passionate about writing code for both work and personal projects. Beyond software development, I'm also interested in business, company-building, and other tech-related topics. This blog will serve as a way to document my progress and insights in these areas, as well as to connect with others who share similar interests.
