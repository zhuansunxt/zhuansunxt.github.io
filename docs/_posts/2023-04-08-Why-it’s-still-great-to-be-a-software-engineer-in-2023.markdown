Apr 8th, 2023, 5:29PM, me typing this blog post in the dining room at home. I wanted to start with something general but useful on my new blog site, so I typed out this title “Why it’s still great to be a software engineer in 2023”, then only to realize I got nothing concrete to say about it. I agree with the statement, but I just don’t know where to start.

The software I’m using is Notion and it has integrated AI support, so I asked my AI assistant to write a blog post about the exact topic, hoping it will give me material to add on. Here is that it gives me: 

> In 2023, being a software engineer is still a great career choice due to several reasons.
> 

> Firstly, the demand for software engineers is only increasing every year. As technology continues to advance and companies require more complex software solutions, the need for skilled software engineers grows. This means that software engineers are in high demand and can often command high salaries.
> 

> Secondly, software engineering is a constantly evolving field. There are always new technologies and programming languages to learn, which means that software engineers are constantly challenged and stimulated. This makes for a dynamic and rewarding career path.
> 

> Thirdly, software engineering offers the opportunity for remote work. As companies embrace more flexible work arrangements, software engineers can often work from anywhere in the world, as long as they have a reliable internet connection. This provides greater work-life balance and the chance to travel while still earning a good income.
> 

> Finally, software engineering is a field that offers the opportunity to make a positive impact on the world. Software engineers can work on projects that improve people's lives, such as in healthcare, education, and environmental sustainability. This sense of purpose can be incredibly fulfilling and motivating.
> 

> In conclusion, being a software engineer in 2023 is still a great career choice due to the increasing demand, constant evolution, opportunity for remote work, and potential to make a positive impact on the world.
> 

Not bad. Let’s dissect what the AI assistant says and see if they are also the reason what I had in mind.

In simpler terms, the first reason for the growing demand might seem a bit out of touch with the current situation in April 2023. Big tech companies are experiencing lay-offs, and there are frequent news stories about job cuts in the tech sector. From what I've gathered, the overall pay for software engineers in the Bay Area is decreasing. For recent college graduates, finding an entry-level job this year could be the toughest it's been in the past decade. While it's true that software engineering has been in high demand due to the tech industry's growth in previous years, my AI knowledge on the subject might be a bit outdated.

The second reason, which is the ever-evolving nature of software engineering, is a more valid point. If you enjoy learning and mastering new skills, programming can be rewarding as there's always innovation in tools, languages, frameworks, and research. However, this might not suit those seeking a more stable field where experience takes precedence over constant adaptations. That said, in software engineering, experience remains valuable, particularly for managing large-scale systems, but learning new skills is essential too.

I won't dwell on the benefits of remote work, as I never fully understood why it's considered so important by many. Although I mostly work from home, my most productive and refreshing day is often the one spent at the office. Software engineering involves creating great software and working with machines, but collaborating with real people is essential for success. Working with talented individuals can be a powerful motivator, and I believe face-to-face interactions can boost productivity for software engineers just as much as in other industries.

I completely agree with the final reason: making a positive product and social impact is a huge motivator in my current job. Although people in various roles can make a difference, software engineers may find the most satisfaction in bringing a product to life from scratch. Tech products and infrastructure that change people's lives don't come to fruition through pitch decks or market analysis – they need to be built! Software engineers are the ones who skillfully and efficiently translate a product manager's vision into reality, constructing complex systems one line of code at a time.

Another thing to build on top of that, is that I see software engineers are in a very good position to expand their roles from a technical one to other areas. Speaking from my personal experience, I found that a lot of the time I need to wear multiple hats in my job, sometimes being a product manager talking to customers, understanding their pain points and setting the product roadmap; sometimes being a project manager putting together a project execution plan and oversee its execution; sometimes a people lead mentoring other junior members on both their technical challenges and career growths, and sometimes even a technical writer to draft user-facing documentations and user guides. The reason a software engineer is in a good position to take those extra responsibility is that they are the one who understands every aspects of how a product is built and how things work. It allows them to solve problems at both a broader angle and narrower angle: being a product builder, you can understand the key use case and drive the product roadmap (being a product manager), and you can also come up with a detailed plan on how to make existing feature better with a very detailed insight (being a project manager). I can speak for other people, but I found myself enjoy wearing those hats and work the way up to deliver values to my users out there.

Besides those talking points generated by an AI, I really don’t have lots of other things to add. But I still have not touched on a keyword in the title: why 2023? Those reasons you (or the AI) comes up with still apply in other times, and given the current uprising AI/LLM, is it getting less appealing to be a software engineer since bots are starting to code? Well, I personally got really excited by the emergent capabilities of AI in the past few months and I already started to have ChatGPT at my side during work to write me code snippets. In fact, I believe this development makes software engineering even more attractive. Not all coding tasks are enjoyable, and not all knowledge needs to be memorized by humans. With AI's assistance, software engineers can focus on higher-value aspects of their projects while their virtual assistants handle mundane tasks and boilerplate code. AI may eventually progress to designing complex distributed systems, but until artificial general intelligence (AGI) is achieved, I doubt a probabilistic language model can independently invent new technologies, identify the right problems to tackle, or create groundbreaking ideas from scratch.
